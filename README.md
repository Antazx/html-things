## My HTML things

### [Headings and paragraphs](./titles-and-paragraphs/index.html) 
Headings tags are not only  to control the size of the text, they also have their own meaning. We shouldn't write h2 headings without writting h1 heading before and so on.

### [Header Main and Footer](./header-main-footer/index.html)
It's important to structure the HTML code with this 3 tags, header must contain navigation menus, logos, social media links... footer should contain usefull information, contact links, FAQs, creator name, the small print of the contracts... main has all the relevant content of the page.
