# My HTML things

## [Headings and paragraphs](./titles-and-paragraphs/index.html) 
Headings tags are not only  to control the size of the text, they also have their own meaning. We shouldn't write h2 headings without writting h1 heading before and so on.

## [Header Main and Footer](./header-main-footer/index.html)
It's important to structure the HTML code with this 3 tags, 
- header must contain navigation menus, logos, social media links...
- footer should contain usefull information, contact links, FAQs, creator name, the small print of the contracts... - main has all the relevant content of the page.

## [Section Article and Aside](./section-article-aside/index.html)
Content section labels, section can contain articles and articles can contain sections
- section: generic container used to group related content. When we are creating blocks wich content is related to an upper block we will use sections.
- article: container that represents independent content, i.e. when we can read that fragment elsewhere and it would make sense on its own. 
- aside: used to display content that is related but not part of the main content. It can be placed inside or outside the main tag.

Nesting: section can contain articles, i.e. if we have some articles about HTML tags, they should be placed inside one section, due to they have related content, and articles would be independent because we could read one whitout reading the others and it would still have its own sense. Article is defined as component of the page with independent content, this tag could have a header and a footer.

## [Block and Line elements](./block-and-line-elements/index.html)
Block elements will occupy the full available width even if their content does not, so the elements below will go to the following line. Line elements will take only the width they need, so it's possible to display more than one element in the same line.
